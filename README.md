## Game Recommendation System

This repository contains a Machine Learning project aimed at building a **Game Recommendation System** that helps users discover video games that match their preferences, using both **Content-Based Filtering** and **Collaborative Filtering** approaches.

### Project Overview

With the growing number of video games released every year, users often struggle to find titles that truly match their interests. This project leverages Machine Learning techniques to build an intelligent recommendation system that enhances user experience on game distribution platforms.

### Objectives

* Develop a **Content-Based Filtering (CBF)** model using game metadata and cosine similarity.
* Build a **Collaborative Filtering (CF)** model using the **LightFM** library.
* Evaluate model performance using **Precision\@k** and **Recall\@k**.
* Provide interactive recommendations based on user input.

### Dataset

* **Source**: [Kaggle - Video Game Sales with Ratings](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rush4ratio/video-game-sales-with-ratings)
* Contains game metadata including genre, platform, publisher, rating, and user scores.

### Why This Project Matters

* Helps users find relevant games quickly and accurately.
* Improves engagement and satisfaction on gaming platforms.
* Supports publishers and developers in reaching target audiences.
* Informs product and marketing strategies through user insights.

### Tech Stack

* **Python**
* **Jupyter Notebook**
* **LightFM**
* **Scikit-learn**
* **Pandas & Numpy**
